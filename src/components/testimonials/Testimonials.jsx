            When I interviewed Diego, I immediately knew that he was the
            candidate I was looking for. Committed, motivated, and very
            enthusiastic about his work, it was clear from the start that he
            enjoyed what he was doing. Working with him, I could completely
            trust in his development as he adhered to best practices and
            standards, always documenting the code and keeping it modular and
            well-tested. It was a pleasure to work with him, and I would
            definitely hire him again for any project.

            Diego is a highly professional and self-taught developer, with the
            ability to adapt to new technologies and initiatives, and a strong
            willingness to continue growing as a Software Engineer. I had the
            pleasure of working with him as a frontend developer, using
            frameworks such as Angular, React, Bootstrap, as well as
            implementing components directly in HTML and CSS. It was a pleasure
            to collaborate with him on projects that provided significant value
            to the client and users.
